But this is only for first year of the course. That's all about scholarship. Good luck. P.S. 312 + get scholarship generally,,

25/02/17,2,9,55,PM, ?+91 77588 38698?, A small query though. Why do you think U conn is beter than UTD for msba. I found the curriculum at UTD better than UCONN.,,
25/02/17,2,10,23,PM, ?+1 (708) 979?2424?, Reality related to BA is that its a pretty easy course. So basically anyone with a dependent visa goes for a business analytics course. Every consultant here has an online course related to BA  that he uses to make you capable to crack an interview. BA can be considered if you are fed up with coding and stuff or you are doing your masters just to enter to the States. I don't suggest anyone without a scholarship to get into UTD if you have other admits. Its not that The University is really bad but its coz the course is not worth it. If you have other admits work hard to get the pros and cons of other universities .Anyone trying to get into US expecting something good should better be going off to computer science because technical people are really appreciated in US. Job roles like Business analyst they prefer someone from the US because they already have the knowledge regarding the work culture and industries over here ... business analyst role is not amongst those that gonna make you a lot of money if money is your aim to come to states .. Its all about priorities. Its my research as of now and most of you might experience something related once you reach here. Nothing to demotivate but people who are double minded. Rethink about your decision,,
25/02/17,2,11,56,PM, ?+91 99097 20022?, ??,,
25/02/17,2,13,22,PM, ?+91 77588 38698?, Fair enough. But,,
25/02/17,2,13,57,PM, ?+91 88793 31065?, Agreed ! Management degrees indians are at a disadvantage.. we r good at coding and people love how we work extra hours to get the code running??..,,

25/02/17,2,15,45,PM, ?+91 99230 59645?, I was of the assumption that BA is a hard core technical course,,
25/02/17,2,16,7:00 AM,PM, ?+91 94385 68688?, Thats why Ritesh,,
25/02/17,2,16,9:00 AM,PM, ?+91 99230 59645?, Atleast that's what they make it look like from the curriculum,,

25/02/17,2,16,47,PM, ?+1 (708) 979?2424?, That works but then post your course you are confined to work on the roles that are somewhat different from you coursework. Business analytics course lands up to jobs related to business analyst . Your experience can get you roles like data analyst or data scientist but it eventually it becomes difficult to compete with the computer science students majoring in data science,,
25/02/17,2,17,3:00 AM,PM, ?+91 88793 31065?, But coming to the point why i chose BA its not coz im fed up of coding i want to switch to a BA role with my present BI DW skill set would that be possible ?,,

25/02/17,2,18,28,PM, ?+1 (708) 979?2424?, Not at all the data science track that they are introducing now is still so non technical that the machine learning subject teaches you to implement the algorithms not to code them from scratch,,
25/02/17,2,19,23,PM, ?+91 77588 38698?, Exactly my point. BA is different from DS. And as you said,,
